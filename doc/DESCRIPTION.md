Mastodon Archive Reader Lite (MARL) is a lightweight, single-page app that provides a user-friendly interface to explore the content of a Mastodon archive file: account data, posts, attachments, etc.

It runs by default in Local Mode, i.e. in-browser and does not store any user data on the server (apart from the access log as per your YNH configuration).
However you can also set it in Server Mode via the app configuration options, in order to display permanently one or several Mastodon archives stored online.
