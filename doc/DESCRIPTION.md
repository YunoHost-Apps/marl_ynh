Mastodon Archive Reader Lite (MARL) is a lightweight, single-page app that provides a user-friendly interface to explore the content of a Mastodon archive file: account data, posts, attachments, etc.

It runs in-browser and does not store any user data on the server (apart from the access log as per your YNH configuration).
